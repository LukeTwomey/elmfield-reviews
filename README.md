# Elmfield Reviews

This app was created to aid the residents of Elmfield Road in their search for reliable tradespeople.

In the same manner as tools like Checkatrade, or Trustatrader, this app intends to collate the contact details for reputable companies, displaying reviews from the residents who have used them in the past.

People will often ask for recommendations in the street whatsapp group, showing there is an appetite for more personal, localised recommendations from friends and neighbours, aside from the bigger sites mentioned above.

The client is written in React. The back-end consists of an API written in Node and a PostGresDB to hold the company and review data. Both are deployed to Railway.
